# Welcome to this counter app! 👋🏻

Since I started learning React the useState concept was a bit difficult to grasp, so I made this project to practice what I learned in a playful way. 👀

### Enjoy! :)

## React + Vite
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

@vitejs/plugin-react uses Babel for Fast Refresh
@vitejs/plugin-react-swc uses SWC for Fast Refresh
